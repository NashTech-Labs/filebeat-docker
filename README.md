# Filebeat configuration

This is a simple tech hub of how to run Filebeat via Docker to send logs of your application to ELK stack at provider like [logz.io](https://logz.io).  

Run docker compose and check your ELK:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

You would be able to see the logs there.
I have created a demo example of how the logs should look like in the example.logs file.
